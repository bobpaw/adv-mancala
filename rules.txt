Rules:
The board consists of 6 small slots on each side, with the side on the bottom, "closest" to you
being yours, as well as two large slots on the ends. The large slot on the right is also yours.
This large slot is called the Mancala.
The goal of the game is to capture the most pieces in your Mancala.

On your turn:

-Select one of the small slots on your side, and confirm this selection.
-The pieces in the slot will be picked up, and starting from the slot immediately to the right,
one will be placed in each slot, traveling the board counter-clockwise, including your 
Mancala, but not your opponent's. The pieces will travel in this matter until all the 
pieces are deposited.
- If the last piece is deposited in your own Mancala, you take another turn.
- If the last piece is deposited in an empty small slot on your side, take all the pieces in 
your opponent's slot directly opposite it and deposit them directly in your Mancala.

Win condition:

Once all of one player's small slots are empty, the game ends. The player who still has 
pieces in their slots places all those pieces into their Mancala. At this point, the player
with the most pieces in their Mancala wins.
